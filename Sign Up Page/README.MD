## Introduction  

Hey! I'm **Shoaib Abdullaleem**, an aspiring **web developer & designer** who finally decided to stop overthinking and just start coding. This **Signup Page** is my first project using **HTML & CSS**, designed in **Figma** after scrolling through way too many design inspirations.  

At first, I put it off for way too long, thinking *"Eh, this is going to be impossible."* But after messing around with it (and questioning my choices), I finally got it doneâ€”and here it is!

## The Great Re-Upload (Now With Responsiveness!)  

So, fun fact: I actually uploaded this project before, but then I realizedâ€¦ it wasnâ€™t **responsive**. Whoops.  

- I originally designed it **for mobile**, but somehow, in the process, it ended up working well on **iPads** too. So thatâ€™s a win!  
- Added a **live preview link** because, well, why build a site if no one can see it?

## Challenges & What I Learned  

- **Margins, paddings, and spacing**? Yeah, that took way too long to figure out. It was basically trial and error (mostly error).  
- Iâ€™ve played around with **Figma** before, but this made me realize I have a lot more to learn. My next designs will (hopefully) be **cleaner and more minimal**.  
- Making this **responsive** was tricky, but I got it working! Now it actually adjusts to different screens like itâ€™s supposed to.

## Whatâ€™s Next?  

This is just the beginning! Next up, Iâ€™ll be working on **better designs, cleaner code, and bigger projects**. Hopefully with less frustration.
