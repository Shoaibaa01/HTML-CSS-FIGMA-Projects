## Challenges & Learning Experience  

- **Margins, padding, and spacing** gave me a tough time, But after lots of trial and error, I started getting the hang of it.  
- I had some experience with **Figma**, but I know I can do better. My future designs will be more **minimal, clean, and aesthetic**.  
- Coding this design into actual **HTML & CSS** was harder than expected, but I made it!

# Project Limitations

**No Responsive Design:** Turns out, making a website work on different screens isnâ€™t as easy as resizing an image.
