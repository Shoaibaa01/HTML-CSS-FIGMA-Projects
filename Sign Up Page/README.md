## Challenges & Learning Experience  

- **Margins, padding, and spacing** gave me a tough time. It felt like an unsolvable puzzle, but after lots of trial and error, I started getting the hang of it.  
- I had some experience with **Figma**, but I know I can do better. My future designs will be more **minimal, clean, and aesthetic**.  
- Coding this design into actual **HTML & CSS** was harder than expected, but I made it!

# Project Limitations & Future Improvements

- **No Responsive Design:** Turns out, making a website work on different screens isn’t as easy as resizing an image. Future me, take notes.
- **Areas to Improve:**
  - Actually understanding **Figma** instead of winging it.
  - Cracking the enigma that is **CSS spacing and layouts**.
  - Taking on **bigger, badder projects** (hopefully without the existential crisis).

## What's Next?  

This is just the beginning! Next time, my designs will be even **better**, more **refined**, and definitely **more challenging**. Excited for what's ahead! 🎨💻
