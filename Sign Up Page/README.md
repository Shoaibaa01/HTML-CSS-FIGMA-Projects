# Introduction

Hey there! My name is **Shoaib Abdul Aleem**, and this is my very first attempt at web design and development using **HTML, CSS, and Figma**. Spoiler alert: It was a wild ride! üöÄ

Designing this **Signup Page** was an emotional rollercoaster. I procrastinated like a champ, doubted my life choices, but in the end, I emerged victorious (sort of). 

---

# Design Process

1. I bravely opened **Figma** (which I barely knew how to use) and started designing the **Signup Page**.
2. Took inspiration from other designs because, let‚Äôs be real, creativity doesn‚Äôt happen in isolation.
3. Added my own magic touch with **custom images, fonts, and layouts**‚Äîbecause why not?

# Development Challenges

Oh boy, where do I start?
- **Margins, paddings, and spacings**? More like a cryptic puzzle from an ancient civilization.
- Matching my design from **Figma to actual code** was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole‚Äîtrial and error all the way.
- I avoided using **AI tools** because, well, I wanted to prove I have a few functional brain cells left. ü§ñüö´

# Project Limitations & Future Improvements

- **No Responsive Design:** Turns out, making a website work on different screens isn‚Äôt as easy as resizing an image. Future me, take notes.
- **Areas to Improve:**
  - Actually understanding **Figma** instead of winging it.
  - Cracking the enigma that is **CSS spacing and layouts**.
  - Taking on **bigger, badder projects** (hopefully without the existential crisis).
