# Introduction

Hello! My name is **Shoaib Abdul Aleem**, and this is my first project using **HTML, CSS, and Figma**. It was both exciting and challenging, but I learned a lot along the way.

For this project, I designed a **Signup Page** using Figma and then built it with HTML and CSS. At first, I struggled a bit with motivation, but I pushed through and managed to complete it!

# Design Process

1. I started by designing the **Signup Page** in **Figma**, even though I was new to it.
2. I took inspiration from different designs but made sure to add my own unique touch.
3. I customized the page with **images, fonts, and layouts** to make it more visually appealing.

# Development Challenges

While converting my Figma design into **HTML & CSS**, I faced some difficulties:
- Understanding **margins, paddings, and spacing** took a lot of trial and error.
- Translating the design into actual code was more challenging than I expected.
- I avoided using AI tools because I wanted to learn and build everything myself.

# Project Limitations & Future Improvements

- **No Responsive Design Yet:** This project is not optimized for different screen sizes, but I plan to work on that in future projects.
- **Areas to Improve:**
  - Gaining a better understanding of **Figmaâ€™s design tools**.
  - Improving my knowledge of **CSS layouts and spacing**.
  - Taking on **more complex projects** to enhance my skills.
