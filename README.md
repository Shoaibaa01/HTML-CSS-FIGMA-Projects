# HTML, CSS & Figma Projects ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»  

Hey, Iâ€™m **Shoaib Abdul Aleem**, and this repository is where Iâ€™m learning and experimenting with **HTML, CSS, and Figma**. No JavaScript, no fancy frameworksâ€”just the basics, done well (hopefully).  

Iâ€™m starting from scratch, building **10 to 20 projects** to get comfortable with web design and styling. Itâ€™s my way of practicing, improving, and figuring things out as I go. Once Iâ€™ve got a solid grasp, Iâ€™ll move on to **JavaScript** and start adding interactivity.  

For now, itâ€™s just HTML, CSS, and a lot of trial and error. Letâ€™s see how this goes. ðŸš€
